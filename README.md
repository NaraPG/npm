## Concepts

> - the `Command Line Interface (CLI)`: runs from a terminal, and is how most developers interact with npm.
> - the `registry`: is a large public database of JavaScript software and the meta-information surrounding it.

## Main Commands
> - `npm install`: Install package.json dependencies.
> - `npm-windows-upgrade`: Upgrade npm on Windows.
> - `npm outdated -g --depth=0`: Update global packages.
> - `npm run`: list available scripts to run.
> - `npm install -g npm@latest`: Update npm
> - `npm update -g <package> <package> <package>`: To update global packages individually.

## Usage
> - When you have a node project with a package.json file, you can run `npm install` or `npm i` from the project root and npm will install all the dependencies listed in the package.json.
